What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-when you initialize a repository git creates a .git file witch is used for managing the differences
between all the different versions of the files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
-staging area is the area where we position the files that we want to add to the repository from the
working directory, so the value it offers is as an intermediate area between the two.
