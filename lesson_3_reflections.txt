When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-when there are other people working on the same project, or when someone else uses the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
-because you have control over what branch gets pull and when it is pulled so that you can finish 
your part without interference from an automatic pull, making changes from underneath you feet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?
-fork is a special clone on github, clone is simply copying a repository, and branches are used
to give one or more commits a name and to separate them from the rest of the changes and commits
on the repository.
